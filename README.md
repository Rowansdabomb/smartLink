# SmartLink *Beta*

SmartLink is a free to use chrome exstension which generates links that scroll to and highlight text of interest.

Use:
 - install the exstension to chrome
 - select text as normal
 - right click and select the Copy SmartLink option
 - paste your SmartLink
 
SmartLink does not interfere with the normal functionality of links, so users without the exstension can still use the SmartLink as a normal url.
