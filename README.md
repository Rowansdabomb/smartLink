# Curl *Beta*

Curl, stands for curated URL, is a free to use chrome exstension which generates links that scroll to and highlight text of interest.

# Use
Selection:
 - install the exstension to chrome
 - select text as normal
 - right click and select the Copy SmartLink option
 - paste your SmartLink

Reception:
 - click the curl, it will take you to the first selection
 - if there are multiple selections, click the exstension icon in the top right and press next or prev.
 
Customization:
 - you can adjust the highlight color by click the exstension icon in the top right.
 
Curl links do not interfere with the normal functionality of url links, so users without the exstension can still use the Curl link as a normal url.
